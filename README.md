# HamsterModell
Similar to the hamster model (https://www.java-hamster-modell.de), a robot hamster should be able to be controlled on a playing field. To do this, a connection is established between a PC and the robot. For this purpose, an associated Python library is being developed for programmers to control it using simple commands. 
<br />For this, there are existing 3 files:
```
hamster_control_test_version.py
hamster_test_version.py
pc_test_version.py
```
